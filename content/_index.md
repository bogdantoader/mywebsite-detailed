I am a postdoctoral scientist at the [MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk), developing computational methods for [cryo-ET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_tomography) in the groups of Dr Sjors Scheres and Dr Tanmay Bharat in the Division of Structural Studies.

Previous positions:
  * Postdoc in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.yale.edu)
and the [Quantitative Biology Institute](https://qbio.yale.edu) at Yale University:
algorithms for [cryo-EM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_microscopy). 
  * Postdoc in the [Cambridge Advanced Imaging Centre](https://caic.bio.cam.ac.uk) 
at the University of Cambridge: deconvolution for microscopy data, 
  * DPhil in the [Numerical Analysis Group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis)
and
[InFoMM](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/industrially-focused-mathematical-modelling-epsrc-cdt) 
at the University of Oxford under the supervision of 
[Prof. Jared Tanner](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tanner/) and 
[Dr. Andrew Thompson](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/thompson/),
in collaboration with the 
[National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk/).
My [thesis](Bogdan_Toader_thesis.pdf) was on grid-free compressed sensing/super-resolution.

During Sep 2022 - Dec 2022, I was a core participant of the 
[IPAM long program on computational microscopy](http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/long-programs/computational-microscopy/) at UCLA, 
and during October 2018 - March 2019, I was an  enrichment student at the 
[Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk),
UK's national institute for data science and artificial intelligence.

Previously, I received a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from 
the University of Manchester and I worked for three years
as a software developer in the financial sector in London.
